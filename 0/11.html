                <h1>Some Thoughts About Resources</h1>


                <p>
                    As far as I know, a resource is (by definition) something that should be destroyed when it's no longer needed.
                    Examples include a memory allocation that should be deallocated, a file handle that should be closed, and so on.
                    Some type systems (affine type systems, linear type systems, maybe others) seem to explicitly account for the existence of resources.
                    But why does this concept exist in the first place?
                </p> <p>
                    Resources don't seem to be message objects.
                    In fact, I'm not sure if it makes sense to call them objects at all, since they don't seem to encapsulate the state that defines them.
                    Are they just an identifier/reference associated with an obligation that hasn't been honored yet?
                    An incomplete computation?
                    An unfinished conversation between two objects?
                </p> <p>
                    In C#, a FileSystem service might expose an OpenFile method that returns a FileHandle resource that implements IDisposable.
                    But the FileSystem needs to trust that Dispose will be called by some external piece of logic; it can't enforce that invariant.
                    How is that acceptable, when the state of the FileSystem is normally the responsibility of the FileSystem itself?
                </p> <p>
                    Suppose that a FileSystem service exposes an OpenFile&lt;T&gt; method that accepts Func&lt;FileHandle, T&gt; as a continuation parameter and returns T.
                    In this case, FileHandle doesn't need to implement IDisposable, and the FileSystem doesn't need to trust any external piece of logic.
                    Instead, the FileSystem can just invoke CloseFile after the continuation is executed but before the result is returned.
                    Is there any downside to this approach?
                    If not, then why does IDisposable exist?
                </p> <p>
                    If continuations are used in the same way for memory management, then I think some things become impossible.
                    So perhaps there is a disadvantage, and perhaps that disadvantage is sufficient to motivate the concept of resources in general.
                    But I'm not yet convinced that anything of value is lost by using continuations, since it seems quite plausible to me that only undesirable things become impossible.
                </p> <p>
                    Is there a lesson here?
                    I don't know.
                </p>
