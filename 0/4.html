                <h1>Some Thoughts About Software Architecture</h1>


                <h2>Object-Oriented Semantics</h2>


                <h3>Objects</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Objects can't be created with an invalid state.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Message Objects</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Message objects are objects.</li>
                    <li>They're always immutable.</li>
                    <li>They can't expose methods that have impure preconditions.</li>
                    <li>They can't expose methods that have impure postconditions.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Value Objects</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Value objects are message objects.</li>
                    <li>They always comply with some set of value constraints.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance is used primarily to add additional value constraints.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Record Objects</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Record objects are message objects.</li>
                    <li>They always expose some set of properties.</li>
                    <li>Inheritance is used primarily to add additional properties.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Service Objects</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Service objects are objects.</li>
                    <li>They can expose methods that have impure preconditions.</li>
                    <li>They can expose methods that have impure postconditions.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Ports</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Ports are service objects.</li>
                    <li>They can send messages directly to the host environment.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Adapters</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>Adapters are service objects.</li>
                    <li>They can't send messages directly to the host environment.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Comments</h3>


                <p>
                    The properties of a record object should be orthogonal to each other, meaning that you can't infer anything about the value of one property based on the value of another.
                    Otherwise there's a risk of inconsistency, and you need to go out of your way to validate the relevant invariants.
                </p> <p>
                    Service objects are usually (always?) immutable.
                    Often they're stateless, but sometimes they hold a configuration.
                    The configuration constrains the set of interfaces that the service object can reasonably implement.
                    A configuration that exposes more properties can generally be used to implement more interfaces.
                    A configuration that exposes value objects with relatively strict value constraints can generally be used to implement relatively strict interfaces.
                </p> <p>
                    Most service objects implement an interface, and most interfaces define a protocol for communicating with service objects.
                    It may sometimes be useful to define an interface for communicating with message objects, but even if that's the case, it's the exception and not the rule.
                </p> <p>
                    Service objects typically control access to an external system that is both stateful and mutable.
                    I suspect that all of the methods exposed by service objects should be (a) idempotent and (b) transactional.
                </p> <p>
                    Adapters don't let you do anything that can't be done with ports, but they can be used to create a new layer of abstraction.
                    In the best case scenario, that higher layer of abstraction completely hides the previous layer of abstraction while reducing the exposed surface area.
                    That decouples higher layers of abstraction from lower layers, such that you can completely replace the lower layers without changing the higher layers.
                </p> <p>
                    I think it's helpful to maintain a mental model where different objects have different visual metaphors.
                    Typically I think of message objects as something physical, like a package, and I think of service objects as something abstract, like the mail system.
                    A programming joke that I've heard, paraphrased: "If somebody asks for a banana, don't give them a monkey that has a banana in one hand and a forest in the other."
                </p> <p>
                    This probably isn't an exhaustive taxonomy of objects-that-have-reasonable-semantics, but hopefully it's a step in that general direction.
                </p>


                <h2>Project Organization</h2>


                <h3>Public Specification</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>The public specification defines message objects and service interfaces.</li>
                    <li>It does not define service objects.</li>
                    <li>It does not depend on the internal specification, the internal implementation, or the public implementation.</li>
                    <li>Every type that it defines has public visibility.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Internal Specification</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>The internal specification defines message objects and service interfaces.</li>
                    <li>It does not define service objects.</li>
                    <li>It does not depend on the internal implementation or the public implementation.</li>
                    <li>Every type that it defines has internal visibility.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Internal Implementation</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>The internal implementation defines service objects.</li>
                    <li>It does not define message objects or service interfaces.</li>
                    <li>It does not depend on the public implementation.</li>
                    <li>Every type that it defines has internal visibility.</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Public Implementation</h3>


                <ul>
                    <li>The public implementation defines service objects.</li>
                    <li>It does not define message objects or service interfaces.</li>
                    <li>Every type that it defines has public visibility.</li>
                </ul>


                <h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>


                <ul>
                    <li>A major version change seems to indicate a change in the public specification of a software component, such that subtyping rules don't allow compatibility.</li>
                    <li>A minor version change seems to indicate a change in the public specification of a software component, such that subtyping rules do allow compatibility.</li>
                    <li>A patch version change seems to indicate a change in the implementation of a software component.</li>
                    <li>The subtyping rules aren't obvious. (Are specifications covariant with respect to some types, contravariant with respect to other types, and invariant in all other cases?)</li>
                    <li>Package managers should validate/enforce semantic versions, but they (mostly?) don't.</li>
                </ul>
