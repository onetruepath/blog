                                    The properties of a record object are usually orthogonal to each other, meaning that you can't infer anything about the value of one property based on the value of another.
                                    I suppose they're basically vectors, and reading a property is basically projecting the vector into a single dimension.
                                </p>

                                    Service objects are usually (always?) immutable.
                                    Often they're stateless, but sometimes they hold a configuration.
                                    The configuration constrains the set of interfaces that the service object can reasonably implement.
                                    A configuration that exposes more properties can generally be used to implement more interfaces.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Most service objects implement an interface, and most interfaces define a protocol for communicating with service objects.
                                    I suppose it sometimes makes sense to define an interface for communicating with message objects, but that's the exception and not the rule.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Service objects typically control access to an external system that is both stateful and mutable.
                                    I suspect that all of the methods exposed by those objects should be (a) idempotent and (b) transactional.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Ports should probably be instantiated by the host environment.
                                    Failing that, they should be instantiated when the component is being initialized.
                                    That means some kind of dependency injection logic should be executed before you enter the event loop (or when handling the first event, I suppose).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Adapters should probably be instantiated in the same place as ports, although this constrains the set of configurations that can be used to instaniate them.
                                    Specifically: It means that you can only include values provided by the host environment in the configuration for the adapter.
                                    (This is because you can't reasonably use IO when the component is being initialized.)
                                    This potentially forces you to define methods with a large number of parameters, which can be annoying.
                                    There are ways to mitigate that problem, but in some cases it's better to bite the bullet.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Adapters don't let you do anything that can't be done with ports, but they can be used to create a new layer of abstraction.
                                    In the best case scenario, that higher layer of abstraction completely hides the previous layer of abstraction while reducing the exposed surface area.
                                    That decouples higher layers of abstraction from lower layers, such that you can completely replace the lower layers without changing the higher layers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Service objects can depend on message objects, but message objects should not depend on service objects.
                                    This mostly follows from the idea that dependency graphs should be acyclic, since service objects necessarily depend on message objects.
                                    Additionally: Internal service objects should not depend on exported service objects, and exported message objects should not depend on internal message objects.
                                    Again, this mostly follows from the idea that dependency graphs should be acyclic.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I think it's helpful to maintain a mental model where different objects have different visual metaphors.
                                    Typically I think of message objects as something physical, like a package, and I think of service objects as something abstract, like the mail system.
                                    A programming joke that I've heard, paraphrased: "If you ask for a banana, you'll get a monkey that has a banana in one hand and a forest in the other."
                                    Sometimes it's surprisingly hard not to write software that way, but I do believe that it can be avoided.
                                    Hopefully some of these ideas are a step in that direction.
