                        <h3>Primitives</h3>
                            <p>
                                Let's start with Null, Unit, and Bool.
                                Null is a type with no values.
                                Unit is a type with one value, which I'll call void.
                                Bool is a type with two values, which I'll call false and true.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now let's add Sigma and Pi.
                                Sigma is an operator that creates a dependent pair type, i.e. a pair type in which the type of the second element can depend on the value of the first element.
                                Pi is an operator that creates a dependent function type, i.e. a function type in which the type of the output can depend on the value of the input.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Let's use (Sigma (: t T) (F t)) to denote dependent pair types and (Pi (: t T) (F t)) to denote dependent function types.
                                In this context t is a value of type T, while F is a function that accepts a value of type T and returns a type. The colon denotes type annotation. Parenthesis denote function application.
                            </p>

                        <h3>Datum Types</h3>
                            <figure>
                                <pre>Datum1 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Unit)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum2 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum1)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum3 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum2)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum4 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum3)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum5 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum4)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum6 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum5)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum7 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum6)</pre>
                                <pre>Datum8 := (Sigma (: b Bool) Datum7)</pre>
                            </figure>

                            <p>
                                The type Datum8 is our encoding for a byte.
                                Conceptually, it's a binary tree of depth eight in which inner nodes are dependent pair types and each leaf node is the Unit type.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A value of type Datum8 is serialized as eight consecutive bits, followed by a void that occupies no space.
                                But this can be interpreted as a path through the aforementioned tree, followed by a value of the type that exists at the end of that path.
                                Let's use 0x00 through 0xff to denote the possible values, and thus the possible paths through a binary tree of depth eight.
                            </p>
                        <h3>Union Types</h3>

                                <pre>Union2(T00 ... T03) := (Sigma (: b Bool) (if b (Union1 T00     T01) (Union1 T02     T03)))</pre>

                                <pre>Union6(T00 ... T3F) := (Sigma (: b Bool) (if b (Union5 T00 ... T1F) (Union5 T20 ... T3F)))</pre>
                                <pre>Union7(T00 ... T7F) := (Sigma (: b Bool) (if b (Union6 T00 ... T3F) (Union6 T40 ... T7F)))</pre>
                                <pre>Union8(T00 ... TFF) := (Sigma (: b Bool) (if b (Union7 T00 ... T7F) (Union7 T80 ... TFF)))</pre>
                            </figure>

                            <p>
                                The type Union8 is our encoding for a union type with an eight bit tag.
                                Conceptually, it's a binary tree of depth eight in which inner nodes are dependent pair types and each leaf node is some type specified by a type parameter.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A value of type Union8(T00 ... TFF) is serialized as a pair of values concatenated together.
                                The first element is an eight bit tag value, i.e. a path through the tree.
                                The second element is a value of the type that was specified by a type parameter and identified by the tag value.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Note that we should probably allow Null as a default parameter type, such that Union8(Unit) is equivalent to Union8(Unit Null ... Null).
                            </p>

                                The type Tuple8 is our encoding for a tuple type with an eight bit index.
                                Conceptually, it's a binary tree of depth eight in which inner nodes are dependent function types and each leaf node is some type specified by a type parameter.

                                A value of type Tuple8(T00 ... TFF) is serialized as a sequence of values concatenated together.
                                Each element is a value of some type that was specified by a type parameter and identified by the value's position within the tuple.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Note that we should probably allow Unit as a default parameter type, such that Tuple8(Bool) is equivalent to Tuple8(Bool Unit ... Unit).
                            </p>
                        <h3>Nonsense</h3>
                            <p>
                                That's about as far as I've gotten so far. Some thoughts:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    If two types with the same number of inhabitants are equivalent, then every type seems to have many possible encodings.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Even if two types are equivalent by the above definition, associated values aren't necessarily the same size.
                                    Example: The value 0x00 inhabits Union8(Unit) and occupies eight bits of space.
                                    The value void occupies Unit and occupies zero bits of space.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Values can inhabit multiple types. Example: The value 0x00 inhabits Union8(Unit) and Union8(Unit, Unit).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    If #T denotes the number of values in T, then #Union8(T00 ... TFF) is equal to (sum #T00 ... #TFF) while #Tuple8(T00 ... TFF) is equal to (product #T00 ... #TFF).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I suspect that (Sigma (: t T) (F t)) and (Pi (: t T) (F t)) are equivalent to Union8(T00...) and Tuple8(T00...),
                                    when the number of inhabitants in T is equal to the number of (non-default) type parameters.
                                    I guess you'd need some kind of mapping to do anything with that?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The logical gate NAND seems to have type Tuple2(Datum1 Datum1 Datum1 Datum1) and value 0b1110.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There must be a way to encode complex functions without wasting space on a tuple that enumerates every possible result.
                                    I guess you need a layer of indirection?
                                    Some kind of pointer to a series of op-codes that are composed to produce the desired output?
                                    I'm not sure.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
