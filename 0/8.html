                        <p>
                            If you want to support error handling, then the semantics should be enforced by the static type system.
                            That usually means returning some kind of tagged union that the static type system understands.
                            This should make it impossible to use the returned value without specifying what to do if there's an error.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you don't want to support error handling, then you shouldn't allow it at all.
                            That usually means throwing an undocumented exception that isn't part of the method's contract.
                            This should make it possible to refactor the code or fix bugs without a breaking change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Error handling should probably be supported for IO and parsing, because that kind of logic tends to fail even if the code is correct.
                            But error handling probably shouldn't be supported for bugs (e.g. failure to comply with preconditions or postconditions).
                            Bugs tend to put the process into an undefined state that can only be addressed by killing the process.
