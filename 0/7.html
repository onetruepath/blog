                <h1>A Billion Dollars Later</h1>
                    <h2>Null</h2>
                        <p>
                            The irony of null references, in a language that always permits them, is that you can't actually use them for anything.
                            If you violate that rule, then convention can't save you, so you condemn yourself and others to an impossible obligation:
                            Either read and memorize the documentation for every method you invoke, or validate all arguments and return values everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Obviously, that isn't practical.
                            All you can really do is validate untrusted arguments, avoid returning null references, and pray that everyone else does the same thing.
                            This is especially true in public methods, because every bad thing becomes worse in public methods.
