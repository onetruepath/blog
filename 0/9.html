                <h1>Some Thoughts About The Byte Order Mark</h1>


                <h2>Context</h2>


                <p>
                    Unicode is (or should be) a standard for encoding lines of text using sequences of codepoints.
                    UTF-8 (and also UTF-16, etc.) is a standard for encoding sequences of codepoints using sequences of bytes.
                    When combined, these can be used to encode lines of text using sequences of bytes.
                    They cannot be used to encode multiple lines of text in a single sequence of bytes without additional assumptions about e.g. the "End Of Line" encoding.
                </p>


                <h2>In Theory</h2>


                <p>
                    U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE is a Unicode codepoint that has two possible uses.
                    The first use, as a zero-width no-break space, is deprecated (but still valid).
                    The second use, as a byte order mark, is not deprecated.
                </p> <p>
                    The first thing to note here is that U+FEFF is ambiguous at the beginning of a file.
                    It could be a byte order mark (i.e. part of the file encoding) or it could be a zero-width no-break space (i.e. part of the file content).
                    Using this codepoint as a zero-width no-break space is now discouraged, but that doesn't actually eliminate the ambiguity when reading a file.
                    You need to make assumptions about the file format to eliminate that ambiguity, but at that point you (should) already know the byte order.
                </p> <p>
                    The second thing to note here is that U+FEFF has no value whatsoever when encoding lines of text as sequences of codepoints.
                    If it has value at all, then it has value only because it lets you infer something about how sequences of codepoints are encoded as sequences of bytes.
                    That's a completely different layer of abstraction, and therefore outside the appropriate scope of the Unicode standard.
                </p> <p>
                    The third thing to note here is that U+FEFF does not let you infer anything about how sequences of codepoints are encoded as sequences of bytes.
                    There are two reasons for this.
                    First, anyone can invent new rules for encoding sequences of codepoints as sequences of bytes (e.g. "UTF-16 Mostly-Big-Endian-But-With-Two-Exceptions").
                    Second, U+FFFE is a valid codepoint, so even in the bizarre scenario where UTF-16 is known but the byte order isn't, you still haven't learned anything.
                    (If this seems wrong, that's probably because U+FFFE is a noncharacter. But noncharacters are, in fact, valid codepoints. Yes, this is weird.)
                </p> <p>
                    My conclusion is that U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE should not exist.
                </p>


                <h2>In Practice</h2>


                <p>
                    There exists a nameless, informally-specified, and ambiguous "file format" typically associated with the "txt" filename extension.
                    We can't realistically convince people to stop using it, so what do we do?
                </p> <p>
                    One answer is that we should invent a new file format which can use UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, or ASCII depending on the first few bytes.
                    A distinct binary prefix can be used for each non-ASCII possibility, and the prefixes can be chosen such that they won't be present in valid ASCII files.
                    And why not have the four distinct binary prefixes map to the same codepoint, using their associated encoding schemes?
                    The Unicode standard defined U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE for exactly this purpose, so we might as well use it, right?
                </p> <p>
                    The first problem is that mapping the four binary prefixes to a single codepoint provides no benefit whatsoever.
                    We can't possibly interpret them as a codepoint until we infer the encoding scheme, but at that point the prefix is no longer useful.
                    Why pretend that the prefixes represent a codepoint when they clearly don't?
                    That just obfuscates the actual abstraction boundaries.
                </p> <p>
                    The second problem is that people were dumping UTF-8 bytestreams to disk before the ink was dry on the relevant specification, and they weren't using a prefix.
                    Are we going to reject those files as malformed ASCII when we write our libraries?
                    Are we going to assume they're actually ISO-8859-1, or Windows-1252, or some other legacy encoding?
                    Maybe that could have made sense, historically, if we couldn't predict that UTF-8 would take over the world.
                    But it definitely doesn't make sense anymore.
                </p> <p>
                    The third problem is that UTF-8 took over the world, and UTF-8 says that one of those binary prefixes looks exactly like a valid codepoint.
                    Now anyone who wants to parse a text file needs to figure out if the first few bytes represent a binary prefix or an actual codepoint.
                    In other words, they need to infer the file format, but they can't, which is basically the same issue that we started with.
                    (Mapping the binary prefixes to a codepoint for no reason isn't as harmless as it seems, apparently.)
                </p> <p>
                    My conclusion is that U+FEFF ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE should never be used if it can possibly be avoided.
                    We probably need to tolerate it when reading text files, at least for now, but it should be understood that writing it to disk is fundamentally unreasonable.
                    Sometimes we need to do unreasonable things, when we interact with existing software that is itself unreasonable, but often we can fix the existing software.
                    And the first step in that process is recognizing what is, in fact, unreasonable.
