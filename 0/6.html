                <h1>Filesystem Paths Are Underspecified</h1>


                <p>
                    What is a filesystem path on Linux?
                    (This question is even more painful on Windows.)
                    It's tempting to believe that it's a list of strings (the path components) encoded as a single string (by using '/' as a delimiter).
                    This is wrong.
                </p> <p>
                    First, a path is not a UTF-8 encoded string.
                    Many bytestrings that are valid as UTF-8 encoded strings are not valid as filesystem paths,
                    and many bytestrings that are valid as filesystem paths are not valid as UTF-8 encoded strings.
                </p> <p>
                    Second, a path is not (just) an ISO-8859-1 encoded string.
                    Many bytestrings that are valid as ISO-8859-1 encoded strings are not valid as filesystem paths.
                </p> <p>
                    You could argue that a path is an ISO-8859-1 encoded string-that-doesn't-contain-the-null-character, but that's not a standard interpretation.
                </p> <p>
                    Third, even if you interpret a path as an ISO-8859-1 encoded string-that-doesn't-contain-the-null-character, a path component still isn't (just) a string.
                    At best, it's a string-that-doesn't-contain-the-null-character-or-the-slash-character.
                </p> <p>
                    Fourth, a path is not (just) a bytestring.
                    At best, you can say that it is a bytestring-that-doesn't-contain-0x00.
                </p> <p>
                    Fifth, even if you interpret a path as a bytestring-that-doesn't-contain-0x00, a path component still isn't (just) a bytestring.
                    At best, you can say it is a bytestring-that-doesn't-contain-0x00-or-0x2F.
                </p> <p>
                    So where does that leave us?
                    I think we're forced to define a filesystem path as a list of bytestrings-that-don't-contain-0x00-or-0x2F,
                    encoded as a single bytestring-that-doesn't-contain-0x00 (by using 0x2F as a delimiter and appending 0x00 as a sentinel).
                </p>
